# TODO

## Before beta group

- test on ipad
- install button
- add to app store
- landscape not working on android

- is it possible to track clicking on the share button? it is also possible to track results to see hints used?

- redirect from misspelling. or put simple game on misspelling. also include tracking there.

## Before wider sharing

## Potential follow ups

- auto update game cache or at least have automated reminder to extend it. If have this, can have a smaller game cache.
- auto bump version?
- easter egg games

- update icons background to match new theme color
- personal streak/hints used
- limit to 3 hints? if so, can show "Hints remaining: " where would show next game time
- could let people set colors
- issue template form for feedback
