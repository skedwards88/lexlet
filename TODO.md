# TODO

- remove from word games and point to lexlet instead

Maybe:

- unlimited play and control of difficulty like crossjig?
- tutorial?
- google search
- could let people set colors
- add separate share button in controls bar?
- background sync/periodic sync for service worker?

Other name ideas:
