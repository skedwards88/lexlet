# TODO

- personal streak/hints used
- do another word sweep of word lists
- reload fresh game cache

Maybe:

- tutorial?
- google search
- auto update game cache or at least have automated reminder to extend it. If have this, can have a smaller game cache.
- easter egg games
- could let people set colors
- issue template form for feedback
- add separate share button in controls bar?
- background sync/periodic sync?
